/*
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order,
 find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
 Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.
Return the indices of the two numbers index1 and index2, each incremented by one, as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.



Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

func main() {
	numbers := []int{2, 7, 11, 15}

	fmt.Println(twoSum(numbers, 9))
}

func twoSum(numbers []int, target int) []int {
	left := 0
	right := len(numbers) - 1

	for left < right {
		sum := numbers[left] + numbers[right]

		if sum == target {
			return []int{left + 1, right + 1}
		}

		if sum < target {
			left++
		} else {
			right--
		}
	}

	return []int{-1, -1}
